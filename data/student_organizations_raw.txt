This medal is awarded each year to a graduating senior at every accredited college of architecture to encourage professional leadership.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mentoring </strong></p>\r\n<p>A major benefit of Alpha Rho Chi membership is the opportunity for association with the alumni and faculty. Through first-hand information and contemporary experience, these professionals are able to assist in defining academic, personal, and career objectives. Student members have the opportunity to visit design professionals' offices and construction sites and to meet people involved in the building industry. Faculty also serve to council students in career path decisions.

We also have professional development seminars to aid our members in their career development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Corporate Luncheons</strong><br />One of ASME&rsquo;s more popular events is its company luncheons.

These events are open to all engineering students, not just ASME members or mechanical engineering students. These events are designed to allow students the opportunity to learn about potential employers and allow company representatives a chance to reach talented students at the University of Michigan.

Our group does this by sponsoring intramural sports teams in which members join together and compete against other societies at the university. In addition to sporting events, ASME hosts a variety of social activities. Some examples include bowling night, ice skating night, and card tournaments. The strong bonds and team-member atmosphere developed in these events extend into the classroom setting. Upper-class members are brought together with lower-class members to help students create a network of contact and friendship within such a large Mechanical Engineering department.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Service Events</strong><br />ASME strives to be a community service group as well. One of our biggest events is the Fun Run, a 5K run for charity. We co-sponsor this event with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/soc/swe/\">Society of Women Engineers (SWE)</a>. The purpose of this event is to raise money for the local charities in Ann Arbor. Corporate sponsors are sought to help make this event possible. In addition to Fun Run, ASME participates in other community service events. We make and host a dinner at the children&rsquo;s hospital twice a year, we participate in a clean-up of local parks twice a year, and we volunteer at soup kitchens in Ann Arbor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Student-Faculty Relations</strong><br />To encourage communication between students and faculty, ASME co-hosts a student-faculty-mixer once a year. During this event, ASME provides a full buffet of breakfast to students and faculty in the Mechanical Engineering department. ASME officers and engineering professors make pancakes for students and other faculty.</p>","Summary":"ASME at the University of Michigan strives to provide a variety of academic, professional, social, community service, and student-faculty events that enhance the professional and social lives of its members and other students at the University.","CategoryIds":["3649","3652","3654","3658"],"CategoryNames":["Academic/Honor Societies","Science/Technology/Engineering","Graduate/Professional","Service/Service Learning"],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"225543","InstitutionId":66,"ParentOrganizationId":62529,"BranchId":62529,"Name":"American Student Dental Association at the University of Michigan","ShortName":"ASDA","WebsiteKey":"umichasda","ProfilePicture":"4f95fe42-6f68-4e10-a5bd-39801fd56d671e20a80f-83b1-4d68-a99f-73683fa00efa.png","Description":"<p>ASDA is a national student-run organization that protects and advances the rights, interests, and welfare of dental students.&nbsp;</p>","Summary":"ASDA is a national student-run organization that protects and advances the rights, interests, and welfare of dental students.

Please contact Emily (<a href=\"mailto:emilyjr@umich.edu\">emilyjr@umich.edu</a>) for the Zoom link or if you need a ride to the church. These meetings are also a great way to meet your fellow U of M students and just vent about the week of classes. During non-pandemic times, we also have monthly parties on Friday which are hosted by a local family. There really is no agenda for these parties other than to show up with a healthy appetite, a desire to enjoy a home-cooked meal, and be ready to meet a lot of people, play some games and have a good time. We also take Mission trips throughout the year, which can vary from year to year on where we go and what we do.

After much debate and many poetry recitations, the group adopted the name \"Gimble in the Wabe\" from Lewis Carroll's poem,&nbsp;Jabberwocky. Since first performing in April of 1998, the group&rsquo;s name has been refined to Gimble A Cappella, and has evolved into the self-proclaimed quirkiest a cappella group on campus! Each year, Gimblers unite to host 3 concerts and can frequently be seen performing at various events on campus and around the country during their annual spring tour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Gimble released 7 studio albums on CD before their recent releases on streaming platforms. In 2017, they released a 4-song EP, &ldquo;XX,&rdquo; in celebration of their 20th anniversary. Featuring hits like &ldquo;If I Go&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with You&rdquo;, it motivated a wave of new releases. Singles &ldquo;Dancing On My Own&rdquo; and &ldquo;715 - CR&sum;&sum;KS&rdquo; debuted in 2018, followed by &ldquo;Fallingwater&rdquo; and &ldquo;when the party&rsquo;s over&rdquo; late in 2019. The latest 2 would be included on their 5-song EP, &ldquo;home,&rdquo; in 2020. This love-inspired collection of songs was aptly named both for the home they shared together and the unmistakable familial atmosphere of the group. Gimble is excited to continue recording with the amazing&nbsp;Liquid 5th Productions&nbsp;for many years to come!</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Going strong in its 23rd year, Gimble A Cappella continues the tradition with a few fresh faces and a continued passion for a cappella music.

We desire to spur one another on in our mutual journey of faith, to grapple seriously with the intellectual issues of our times from a Christian perspective, and to engage the campus with Jesus Christ. To that end, we have the following objectives:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Spiritual Formation</h3>\r\nGCF is committed to the ongoing development of faithful disciples of Jesus Christ. Through the disciplines of Bible study, prayer, and worship, we seek to become more Christ-like in all areas of our lives. Through small group Bible studies, prayer groups, large group speakers, retreats, and training opportunities, we strive to meet graduate students wherever they are in their spiritual journeys and to challenge them to continued growth and development.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Integration of Faith and Academics</h3>\r\nWe believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord of our whole lives, including both the personal and public areas. As Christian graduate and professional students, Christ calls us to excellence in scholarship and career as well as unwavering obedience to His Word. GCF is committed to affirm the Christian worldview in the university culture by presenting Christian thought in ways that are meaningful to our colleagues and by supporting each other as we explore our call to be servants of Christ in our culture.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Evangelism and Service</h3>\r\nOur primary mission field is the university. We believe that God cares about the university, both the institution and the people who study and work there. Because we feel that the best way to reach other graduate students is through one-on-one relationships, we put emphasis on training and encouraging individuals to reach out to non-Christian friends and colleagues. In addition, we organize regular service opportunities for graduate students to help those in need in our community.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Fellowship</h3>\r\nAs graduate and professional students, we are called to live out Christ's love as a community of believers. We desire to be known as a group that has genuine love for one another. Through our Bible studies and prayer groups, large groups, social events and retreats, we can develop friendships which serve as a base of support and encouragement during challenging times.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_aboutSection\">\r\n<h2>The Fellowship</h2>\r\n<p>Graduate Christian Fellowship is a Chapter of <a title=\"InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA\" href=\"http://www.intervaristy.org/\"> InterVarsity Christian Fellowship</a>, which in turn is part of a world-wide, student-led Christian movement, active in colleges and universities, known as the <a title=\"IFES Website\" href=\"http://www.ifesworld.org/default.asp\">International Fellowship of Evangelical Students</a> (IFES).

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.<br /><br />In 1975, there were no Latino fraternities in existence in the United States. The Greek-letter organizations of the time primarily catered to Anglo and African-American students and graduates. Lambda&rsquo;s founders, as men of vision, realized there was a need to unite the Latino students, develop their leadership skills, impart upon them the value of an education, and instill in them a commitment to their community and culture. The traditional student club would not suffice to accomplish such lofty goals. Hence, Latino unity and brotherhood would be achieved through a long recognized institution &ndash; the fraternity. This newest addition to the Greek system would be the first in the nation, by identity and by name: Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Incorporated.<br /><br />The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the undergraduate level, our brothers are active within the Fraternity and in other student organizations. Our brothers perform community service, promote our culture by sponsoring events which highlight and celebrate our heritage, participate in educational workshops, and enjoy many social programs. As a result of their active participation in every aspect of college life, our undergraduates are developing their organizational, communication, and leadership skills, all while pursuing the coveted diploma. Our younger Lambdas are receiving the training and competence to serve as the future leaders of our brotherhood, community, and nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the professional level, among our ranks you will find attorneys, doctors, and engineers. Our brothers are shaping young minds as educators and as dedicated fathers. The men in brown and white are defending this country at home and abroad in the area of law enforcement and in the armed forces. We are strengthening our country&rsquo;s economy as entrepreneurs. Our brothers are teaching leadership as coaches, mentors, and community activists. The Lambdas are affecting policy and change as elected officials serving on City Councils, Boards of Education, U.S. House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate. In short, Lambdas are contributing and excelling in every facet of human endeavor.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our illustrious history is not only our past but our guiding light to the future. As the first, we overcame many obstacles. Not having much guidance in our formative stages, we persevered and became stronger. Lambda is the product of vision, strength, and unity. Our history serves as a legacy and testament to our accomplishments and greatness.<br /><br />Lambda Theta Phi &hellip; Academic Excellence &ndash; Brotherhood &ndash; Leadership &ndash; Latino Unity -Service.</p>","Summary":"The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service.

More than 40% of the Nicaraguan population lives in rural areas and receives health care from mobile clinics. Currently, mobile clinicians reach rural villages by foot or horseback and are limited in the equipment they can carry. As a result, gynecological exams are performed on makeshift surfaces rather than sterile, standard tables. This system compromises cervical cancer screening accuracy, creates discomfort for clinicians and patients, and limits exam efficiency. These makeshift surfaces also introduce risks for the patient by increasing the likelihood of false negatives. </span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Project MESA aims to alleviate the risks of rural exam environments by introducing a portable gynecological exam table.

Immunization systems in low-resource areas are unsustainable due to a lack of electricity, unreliable transportation, and gaps in the vaccine supply chain. The Solar Fridge is an inexpensive, low-maintenance vaccine storage refrigerator for long-term, on-site vaccine storage that ensures the safety and viability of vaccines in low-resource communities. Between 2008 and 2012, this project transitioned between different departments and teams. Although the general focus of vaccine sustainability has persisted, the user needs and target population were either lost or not found. Therefore, the project has recently focused efforts on the reevaluation of its needs assessment approach. During the summer of 2017, our team performed a problem definition trip with our community partners in Rincon Claro--a small village in the Dominican Republic. We learned that the greatest problem they are facing is on-site vaccine storage, making the Solar Fridge a perfect fit. We also visited other communities and validated this as an overarching problem in this region. This trip has helped Solar Fridge in re-establishing a need, allowing for future progress towards improving vaccine sustainability. Currently, we are pursuing a design using a battery charged with grid and solar power to run a vaccine refrigerator while also working with a design using adsorption refrigeration.</p>","Summary":"The M-HEAL Solar Fridge team is a cross-functional group of diverse undergraduates working to design an electricity-conscious vaccine storage solution for low-resource communities.","CategoryIds":["3652","4212"],"CategoryNames":["Science/Technology/Engineering","Environmental"],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"189974","InstitutionId":66,"ParentOrganizationId":62529,"BranchId":62529,"Name":"M-HEAL The Initiative: Hybrid Infant Warmer","ShortName":"Initiative","WebsiteKey":"mhealtheinitiative","ProfilePicture":"c0f60265-8a54-4850-b43a-ffeb560ae920acaac5c2-384d-43dc-aa42-9ce027ece439.png","Description":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hybrid infant warmer design seeks to seamlessly combine kangaroo care (KC, also called skin-to-skin contact) and an external heating method into one device.

The bassinet houses the heating pad and is the standalone component of the device. The heating pad is the external heating method, and uses a resistive wire to generate heat and a control system to monitor heat output and maintain the system temperature at 37 degrees Celsius. The KC carrier is the wearable component that supports skin-to-skin contact. This component has been mostly developed, and is moving into a more marketing/business focused phase.

Ross School of Business. Each year, MII builds an investment portfolio with the goal of educating members about investing through interactive portfolio management. By maintaining a small, dedicated member base of approximately 60 undergraduate students, MII is able to effectively teach members about investing in a variety of equity, fixed income, and derivative securities. MII is unique in that we manage a $25,000 student-run portfolio. We have complete freedom over our investment strategies and asset classes, which include long/short equity, fixed income, and currencies.</p>\r\n<p>MII utilizes a multifaceted investment strategy involving both fundamental and quantitative analysis to invest in equities, options, and fixed income instruments. We take a disciplined approach to investing, focused on a medium-term outlook for attractive returns while preserving capital. Furthermore, we primarily use a bottom-up approach to source investment ideas, while also implementing top-down and quantitative screening strategies to identify opportunities that will outperform our S&amp;P 500 index benchmark. Additionally, we supplement this fundamental approach to investment selection with technical analysis to identify appropriate entry and exit points for our positions.</p>\r\n<p>MII also provides many resources to help members secure internship and full-time job placements, and hosts the Undergraduate Investment Conference (UIC) each fall. The UIC invites participants from over 20 of the top universities in the country for a featured stock pitch competition. The winner is awarded an approximately $3,000 grand prize, and the Conference includes a keynote speaker and the opportunity for students and corporate partners to meet and network.</p>\r\n<p>We pride ourselves on MII&rsquo;s three core pillars: Education, Investing, and Professional Development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Education</strong></p>\r\n<p>An important goal of MII is to educate members about investing and strengthen their knowledge of financial markets. This goal is comprised of three parts: First, new members have the opportunity to attend &ldquo;Breakfast Club&rdquo; sessions to learn the basics of investing, including how to source investments, value firms, and use financial data tools. Second, senior members make presentations during club meetings on more advanced topics, such as distressed debt investing, options valuation, and monetary policy. Third, every meeting features a market update that provides members with a better understanding of current economic conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Investing</strong></p>\r\n<p>MII builds a student run portfolio through a process in which members evaluate market sectors and pitch their best investment ideas. After the pitch, members vote on whether the security should be added to MII&rsquo;s portfolio. Profits are reinvested into the club, either towards growing the size of the portfolio or funding special events throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professional Development</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our members are high performing. Graduating seniors have gone off into a variety of firms on both the sell side and buy side.

Becoming a member of our facebook group is also recommended.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What is paintball?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: Short answer, it is an exciting adrenaline filled team sport. Teams, of typically 5 players, compete against one another in games of elimination or capture the flag. Players use air powered &ldquo;markers&rdquo; to shoot .68 cal paintballs at one another in order to eliminate the opposing players.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Is paintball safe?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: Paintball is statistically one of the safest sports when the equipment is used in the proper ways. Limits are set on rate of fire and velocity to ensure player safety.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need any experience?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: No. Our group consists of all experience levels. Some of us have played for 5+ years, others are just starting out.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need my own gear?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: No gear is required to join.&nbsp;Rental gear is available at the&nbsp;facilities we play at.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Do you offer discounts on any gear?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: New gear discounts are available from multiple major manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: How much time does it require?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: Low time commitment.

We develop and execute our own research projects in the area of synthetic biology. Students have the opportunity to gain hands on experience in conducting scientific research, running a laboratory, engineering novel biological systems, fundraising, public outreach, leadership, and working as part of a multidisciplinary team. Every year, the team competes in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) jamboree competition in Boston.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>What is Synthetic Biology?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthetic Biology combines biology and engineering to design, construct, and test biological devices and systems. Combining these two disciplines allows us to better understand life, and use that understanding to benefit society. Synthetic Biology is distinct from Genetic Engineering in that the latter only alters existing genes, whereas the former utilizes existing, modified, and man-made genes to make life perform useful functions not normally found in nature. Through synthetic biology, it may be possible to solve some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging problems such as energy shortage, environmental pollution, and disease. However, we must be wary of potential safety and ethical issues along the way.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>What is iGEM?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iGEM is an international undergraduate synthetic biology competition. In 2015, iGEM consisted of 259 teams and 2700 participants from all over the world. Every year, teams research, design, construct, and test a novel biological system. Students have at their disposal bits of DNA from the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological parts to help aid them in building their biological &ldquo;machine&rdquo;. In addition, students are encouraged to build their own parts and develop new techniques to make life easier to engineer. Teams also help to increase awareness for synthetic biology through public outreach and analyze safety concerns as a part of the project design process. Projects are wide ranging and are divided into the following categories: Environment, Food and Nutrition, Energy, Foundational Advance, Health and Medicine, Information Processing, Manufacturing, Software Tools, and New Applications.

Absolutely no previous experience is required. In addition, we always have places for students interested in mathematical modeling, business, programming, web design, and animation. Our team is composed of undergraduate students from a variety of majors, including (but not limited to) Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mathematics, Biophysics, Neuroscience, Microbiology, Philosophy, and Materials Science &amp; Engineering. We also have graduate students and faculty advisors from multiple colleges and departments on campus. Students will become acquainted with the theory and techniques during weekly meetings from February to the end of Winter Semester, at which point we will transition to working on the year&rsquo;s project, continuing into the Spring, Summer, and following Fall Semester, until our competition in late October.

We engage in discussions of scholarly monographs, both foundational older works and newer important books. Our readings cover traditional history, but also cultural, literary, archaeological, economic, and religious topics. The group meets once a month in space provided by the Department of Classical Studies.&nbsp; Discussion at each meeting is led by one group member.</p>\r\n<p>Our evidence for the Roman Republic rarely fits into what traditional historians consider an archive or even truly historical documents. More often, a study of the Roman Republic involves interpreting archaeological data, analyzing political speeches, or extrapolating from contemporary literature of many different genres. Therefore, scholars of the Roman Republic typically come from various disciplines: history, classical studies, classical archaeology, but also art history, philosophy, and political science. Our reading group currently has faculty members from Classical Studies, History, Political Science, and the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, as well as many graduate students in Classical Philology, the Interdepartmental Program in Greek and Roman History, and the Interdepartmental Program in Classical Art and Archaeology.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","Summary":"The Roman Republic Reading Group (R3G) was established by Celia Schultz in 2014 and has run every since.
